I'll admit that Course Design on a Shoestring Budget doesn't sound like comprehensive learning resource but I was able to digest and then explain what I'd learnt from this video suprising well!

## Notes


Bloom's taxonomy covers lower to higher order learning. Each level building on another. This includes:

### Lower order: 

1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply

### Higher order:

4. Analyse
5. Evaluate
6. Create

A advanced course might be tailored to higher order domains and students will be expected to have foundational knowledge.

That’s not to say a course tailored toward higher learning won’t have aspects for lower order domains.

To create a learning objective:

* Start with a stem sentence e.g. "After completing the lesson, the student will be able to..."
* Determine a learning outcome
* Combine with a verb from Bloom's [wheel tool](https://ep.jhu.edu/files/ep-blooms-wheel.pdf)

It's quite a short video so it'd be worth just watching the whole thing.
