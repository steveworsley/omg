## Notes

- Interactivity is about letting information sink in in a more effective way 
- People may think: “I don’t know enough to be a facilitator for this subject.” But you can all learn together. 
- Learning through reflection on doing


### Formula 

- Goals - what do you want people to walk away with?
- Trigger - the thing that they are experiencing and creates the discussion. Not complex but creative. - Discussion - tailor discussion questions to your goal.
- Conclusion - close the workshop in a thoughtful way.This could be a statement or an action. 
- Supporting material - allow anyone in the future to pick up the workshop and run it themselves. - Materials needed - a list of all the things needed to run the workshop

Allison goes into more details on her blog [Workshops for engineers](
http://daydreamsinruby.com/workshops-for-engineers-part-1/):


- Get comfortable with silence
- Ask open ended questions
- Make sure to call out people who haven’t spoken
- Keep the discussion on topic but let it flow
