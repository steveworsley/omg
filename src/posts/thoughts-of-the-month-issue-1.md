As a way to decompress 💆‍♂️ from work I write a few notes on the way home. I’ll add some details and related links then they get posted to Twitter [@iamsteveworsley](https://mobile.twitter.com/iamsteveworsley) and collected here for discussion. ⚡️

Updating a design system, consuming pattern/component libraries and consuming micro-frontends sure is tricky. More places it can fall over but hopefully with the code split the impact of the issues will be smaller.

Anyone else find it hard to provide an immediate and useful update on your work? Or say what you've been doing over the past week if asked out of the blue? [Read more](https://listed.to/@iamsteveworsley/7131/hey-you-what-are-you-working-on)

Lift and Shit: performing a Lift and Shift but leaving the re-platformed code in a worse state than it was originally created. Occurs when a lift is rushed resulting in sudden pain and fumbling of the shift.

I’ve not come across [AHA](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming) before (Avoid Hasty Abstractions) 😆 but I’ve certainly come across some bat-shit abstractions and probably a few I wrote my self. 🙈 The Befuddlement Ratio - Every click through you perform in your IDE your intelligence decreases in percent the number of characters used in the abstracted function name.

See you next time! 🤩
