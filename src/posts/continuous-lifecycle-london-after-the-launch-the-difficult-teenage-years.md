## Notes

. FT has an engagement score Recency Frequency and Volume. Hitting over 18 will mean you’re likely to resubscribe.

. The FT experimented with slowing down the site for users to see what impact that had

Difficult teenage years -

Lack of clear vision
Tech drifting off track
Things not communicated as well as they used to

Strategy

Diagnosis 
Vision
How to get there

Vision - what does good look like?

Might be that vision after launch is same as for launch
FT got an external facilitator to set the vision because there were a lot of people involved who had ownership

. Vision is crucial and you’ll have to work harder to defend that vision
. Use the vision to communicate where we are heading

Highest impact areas to work on

Tell people what the next steps are

You must communicate your vision

It will be new to someone every time you say it

You can have the best vision or strategy but if no one knows about it it’s worthless
